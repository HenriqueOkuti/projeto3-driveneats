# project3-driveneats

Front-end app implementation for a hypotetical food ordering platform for a restaurant called "DrivenEats".

## How to use:

The restaurant only works with combos with the format: Main dish + drink + dessert. So you must pick an option of each category to be able to place your order.

After picking each option you click on "Fechar pedido" to order, after which a prompt will open to confirm your order where you can proceed via "Tudo certo, pode pedir!" or cancel via "Cancelar". Just click on the desired option.

If you proceed with your order you'll be redirected to whatsapp web where you'll be able to place your order direct to the owner's phone number.
